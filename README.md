# Milk-Quality-Assessment (Machine Learning Project: SVM vs Decision Tree)

## Project Objective

This project aims to assess the quality of milk using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to classify milk into categories such as high, medium, or low quality based on various physicochemical properties. The project also compares the performance of two algorithms: **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **Decision Tree**.

## Key Questions (KPIs)

- How accurately can machine learning models classify milk quality based on physicochemical data?
- Which algorithm performs better in terms of accuracy: SVM or Decision Tree?
- What are the most influential features affecting milk quality (e.g., pH, temperature, fat content)?
- Can automated classification support better decision-making in the dairy industry?

## Dataset Used

- Source: [Milk Quality Dataset â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cpluzshrijayan/milkquality)  
- Features: pH, Temperature, Taste, Odor, Fat, Turbidity, Colour, Grade
