# Milk-Quality-Assessment (Machine Learning Project: SVM vs Decision Tree)

## Project Objective

This project aims to assess the quality of milk using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to classify milk into categories such as high, medium, or low quality based on various physicochemical properties. The project also compares the performance of two algorithms: **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **Decision Tree**.
